Energieungleicheit_DE

A few data points for energy inequality in Germany. 
Created out of interest during the energy and inflation crisis 2022/2023.
Data essentially builds on household surveys from Eurostat.
Not a publication associated repo, but data extrapolated and interpolated from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0579-8.
